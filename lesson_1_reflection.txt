1.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Fill in your answer here
    -I want to commit some changes and compare them both so i can compare them later


2.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   	Fill in your answer here
   	- It helped me to see directly the changes made an the difference between both files.

3.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Fill in your answer here
    - That allows me to have all the changes tracked and organized, and it make it easier to work with other people on the same project.

4.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Fill in your answer here
    - A pro will be that i can choose whenever i think the change in the code is meaninful and necessary, in the other hand googledocs will save the file automatically either i need it or not, making the versions confusing to track.

5.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Fill in your answer here
    -Because git is focus on projects that need to have the option of comparing the versions and can have bugs and problems and need to have extra data of the changes made in them that means it gave you some extra features that can come handy in the managment of your projects.

6.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Fill in your answer here
    -git log shows the entire history of file changes and git diff compares two versions and displays the changes made.

7.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Fill in your answer here
    -Because if i make a mistake i can easily go back in the previous version and compare them to see what was the change that introduced the problem.
